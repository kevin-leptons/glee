DEVELOPMENT
===========

        Development Document for <glee>.

INSTALL
=======

        Get <glee> source code from here:

                https://github.com/kevin-leptons/glee

        Get CMake v3.9 from here:

                https://cmake.org/files/v3.9/

        Get Boost v1.65.1 and build follow instructions from here:

                http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_65_0.html

        Get VLC from here:

                https://www.videolan.org/vlc/

        Chose C++ compiler which supports C++11, depend on your platform.
        If you are on GNU/Linux, try search and install gcc package.
        On other platforms, let up your ass and search Google.

        If you are in Debian, you can download pre-build CMake, Boost in
        REFERENCES section and install VLC follow:

                $ dpkg -i cmake_3.9.4_all.deb
                $ dpkg -i libboost_1.65.1_all.deb
                $ apt-get install vlc

BUILDING
========

        Here are building prototype on Bash, you can do this on other
        environments by replace <make> by specific build tool generator,
        such as <nmake> on Windows, etc...

                $ cd glee
                $ mkdir dest
                $ cd dest
                $ cmake ..
                $ make

        After that libraries files is put into <./dest/lib> and executable
        files is put into <./dest/bin>.

        If you are in GNU/Linux platform, you can do building in simple way:

                $ ./ctl build           # build
                $ ./ctl clear           # clear building files
                $ ./ctl dist            # pack glee into Debian package file
                                        # work on Debian only
                                        # distribution file is put into
                                        # ./dist/glee_<version>_all.deb
COMPONENTS
==========

        <./src/glee_core> contains main logic of <glee>.

        <./src/glee_cmd> is library for <glee> command line tools.

        <./src/exe> is executable source files, each file is one executable.
